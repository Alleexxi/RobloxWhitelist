# This is a Roblox Script Whitelist only working with Script-Ware and Synapse

# i do not recommend using this!


Made in 1-2 day i used that project to learn some php/javascript, i think its crackable but i never cracked something or know how to crack.


It's Synapse X and Script-Ware only because it uses Syn-Fingerprint and Fingerprint (Script-Ware).


Put
```php
<Files ~ "\.lua$">
   Order allow,deny
   Deny from all
</Files>
```
in .htaccess
